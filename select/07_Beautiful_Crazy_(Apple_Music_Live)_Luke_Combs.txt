This next one's one of my favourites, uh
For a lot of reasons - I wrote this song two weeks after I met my wife
And, uh, obviously didn't know then, that she was gonna be my wife
But I wrote it with my buddy Rob over here who's from Gastonia
Rob, there may've been a couple of boo's out there, I dunno

Haha, oh, goodness
But, me and Rob wrote this song together
And uh, we won a CMA award with this song - song of the year
Uh, I know that was on your bucket list - it was on mine, too
So, this song's real special 'cause I wrote it with a buddy
It won song of the year, I wrote it about my wife
And, er, we're gonna play it for you

Her say starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine
Takes forever gettin' ready
So she's never on time for anything

When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
And she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me

She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
'Til she changes her mind
And says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me

She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her

Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy

She's crazy
She's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

Thank you!

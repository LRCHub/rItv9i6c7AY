Let's Go Crazy
Let's Go Crazy
If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Sex, sex) is all I heard
Are we gonna let de-elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no Let's Go!
Chorus:
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cuz
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Repeat Chorus
Come on baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
Crazy
Let's go crazy
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go, Let's go
Dr. Everything'll be alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and dafodills will kill
Hang tough children
